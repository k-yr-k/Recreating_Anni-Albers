# Recreating Anni Albers
Recreating Anni Albers' "Untitled", 1969.

![](Recr_AnniAlbers.gif)

Anni Albers' "Untitled" piece from 1969 is a grid of squares with two triangles in each, rotating in a random manner through the grid.  I first counted and assigned the x and y axis to get square counts, and defined the size of the square.  In Albers' work, there were never the same color assigned in each square, and the rotate occurred constantly.  This allowed me to make nested for loops within each squares, and after assign random rotations between 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees.  Finaly, I added shuffle function to change the angles with tracking the mouse movement event in the canvas for a personal manpulation.
